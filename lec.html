<p>What is Lorem Ipsum?<br>
    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the 
    industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and 
    scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
     into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with 
     the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
     software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
